# Oasis-Infobyte-Internship

Repository: Oasis-Infobyte-Internship (Level 2 Tasks)

Task 1: Calculator
In this project, I built a classic calculator, implementing a user-friendly interface that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator allows users to input numbers and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Task 2: Tribute Page
For this task, I created a web page dedicated to honoring and commemorating Steve Jobs. The tribute page provides detailed information about his remarkable achievements, contributions, and significance. It serves as a heartfelt homage to a visionary personality.

Task 3: A Basic To-Do WebApp
In this project, I developed a basic to-do web app designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. Users can easily add new tasks, mark completed ones, and delete unnecessary items. This app proves to be highly beneficial in keeping users organized and responsible.

Throughout Level 2 of the Oasis-Infobyte Internship, I successfully completed these diverse projects, enhancing my skills in web development and creating valuable additions to my portfolio.
